                                   Minecraft is a 3D survival sandbox game developed and published by Mojang, spanning multiple platforms.                                      
                   It was originally created by the independent video game designer Markus Persson in 2009, before giving the development to Jens Bergensten in 2011.                             
                   The game has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.
                   Gameplay is in the first-person perspective.
                   with the core gameplay modes being survival, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health; and creative, in which-
                   -players have unlimited resources, never hunger and are able to fly.
                   The game world is composed of voxels-cubes, commonly called "blocks"-representing various materials,-
                   -such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava, which are arranged in a 3-dimensional grid.
                   Gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects as the player pleases, while being able to move freely around the world.</h2>


<h3>Minecraft was originally created as an experiment to test random generation for caves. Minecraft was inspired by Infiniminer, another game created by Zachary Barth. The first version of Minecraft was released for PC players on May 17, 2009. After going through alpha and beta versions, the full version was released on November 18, 2011. A version for Android was released on October 7, 2011, and an iOS version was released on November 17, 2011.[21] At first, Minecraft was created only by Markus Persson. Other people started to work on it when Persson started an independent video game company called Mojang Specifications. The company was later renamed simply to Mojang. Later in 2011, a version of Minecraft named "Pocket Edition" was released for iOS and Android. In 2012, Persson gave Jens Bergensten the job of being the main developer of Minecraft
